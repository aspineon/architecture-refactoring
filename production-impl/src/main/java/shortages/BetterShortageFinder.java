     * Production at day of expected delivery is quite complex:
     * We are able to produce and deliver just in time at same day
     * but depending on delivery time or scheme of multiple deliveries,
     * we need to plan properly to have right amount of parts ready before delivery time.
     * <p/>
     * Typical schemas are:
     * <li>Delivery at prod day start</li>
     * <li>Delivery till prod day end</li>
     * <li>Delivery during specified shift</li>
     * <li>Multiple deliveries at specified times</li>
     * Schema changes the way how we calculate shortages.
     * Pick of schema depends on customer demand on daily basis and for each product differently.
     * Some customers includes that information in callof document,
     * other stick to single schema per product.â€¨By manual adjustments of demand,
     * customer always specifies desired delivery schema
     * (increase amount in scheduled transport or organize extra transport at given time)
